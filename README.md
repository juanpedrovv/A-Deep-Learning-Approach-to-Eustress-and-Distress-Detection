# A Deep Learning Approach to Eustress and Distress Detection

This study focuses on developing a stress detection model in speech using Deep Learning techniques, specifically employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Motivated by the relevance of stress in the psychological domain and its implications, our main objective is to surpass the state of the art in stress condition classification, distinguishing between eustress and distress. We utilize various open-source databases (RAVDESS, Crema-D, SAVEE, and TESS), re-labeling the data to address the lack of specific training sets. We emphasize the strategic choice of combining features such as MFCC coefficients and the Mel Spectrogram. Our CNN, trained with Data Augmentation and regularization techniques, achieves a remarkable accuracy of 96.01% on the validation set, surpassing previous performance. The combination of MFCC and Mel Spectrogram proves to be crucial, with the Mel Spectrogram standing out as the most distinctive feature in emotional pattern detection. This study not only advances the understanding of vocal stress detection but also provides an effective tool with significant applications in mental health and the optimization of work environments.
